Death Counter Application with Qt
This project is a "Death Counter" app built using Qt, designed for tracking in-game deaths during boss fights. The application features a user-friendly interface where players can input the name of the boss they are fighting, increment the death counter, and keep a record of death counts per boss. The app also saves and loads data using QSettings, ensuring that the death counts and boss names persist across sessions. Users can add, reset, or remove death records from a scrollable list, with a customizable background and button layout for an enhanced experience.
